We're back in the network! So far, we've learned about ssh keys, transferring data, and even how to make changes and debug our code. This week, we will dive further into improving our experience in connecting and exporting data and files across different computers.

As a preface: all work on this blog post is done on a **Mac** computer, and when connected to my `ieng6` account, it is done on Linux software. Thus, some commands can vary if your personal computer is a Mac or Windows device.
