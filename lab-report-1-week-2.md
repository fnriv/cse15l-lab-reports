## remote access - a beginners guide

For most beginners, we are often used to coding on our own personal computers and nothing else. But what happens if we want to collaborate with others or get access to code from our university? Oftentimes, we can connect **_remotely_** to a server on our own computer.  

In fancy terms- this step-by-step tutorial will teach you how to **_log into a course-specific account_** - more specifically the `ieng 6` server. That way, you can easily use your computer to log in to the server using a **secure socket shell**.

Visual Studio Code allows us to connect to the `ieng6` server remotely from our computer.
